## Variables
X, y, z or any other alphabets that are used as "placeholders" to store values ( data ) are known as variables.

## Data types
The variables defined form equations when used. To solve the equations we need them to hold specific types of values and 'data type' is the name being use to define those specific values.
*In Programming language it is a set of data with values having predefined characteristics* 
> Ex. : char, integer, boolean, long int, short int, etc

There are two types of Data Types : 
- System defined data types / Primitive Data types ( int, float, char, double, bool, etc .... )
- User Defined Data types :

## Data Structure 
*Data Structure is a particular way of storinga nd organizing data on a computer so that it can be used efficiently*
