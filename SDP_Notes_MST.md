# PYQ's
#### Q1 a. Why should software development  focus on the needs of Users? 
*Ans*. Software development should focus on the needs of the users for the following reasons : **R<sup>3</sup>**
* To *reduce training and support*costs ( i.e, make it so that users naturally understand how to use the software ).
* To *reduce time to learn* the system..
* To *reduce costs by developing only the required features*.
* To *create a UI accurate to what the user wants*.
* Since UI is the entire application for users, making sure it is good and according to what the user wants is very important.

#### Q1 b. Why must software engineers  develop an understanding of the Users?
*Ans*. The reasons why software engineers must develop and understanding of users are : 
* To understand the goals for the system
	* What is the work the user needs to get done ?
* Potential patterns of use
* Demographics
* Knowledge of application domain
* Physical Ability

#### Q2 a. Differentiate between Usability and Utility with reference to software design pattern
*Ans* 
### Usability

* Does the system allow the user to learn and to use raw capabilities easily?

The Key aspects of usability are : 
  -   **Learnability:** How easy is it for users to learn how to use the system?
    -   **Efficiency:** Once users have learned the system, how quickly can they perform tasks?
    -   **Memorability:** After a period of not using the system, how easily can users re-establish proficiency?
    -   **Error Prevention and Recovery:** How well does the system prevent errors, and if errors occur, how easily can users recover?
    -   **User Satisfaction:** How satisfied are users with their overall experience?

*Example:* An e-commerce website with a clear and intuitive navigation menu, simple checkout process, and helpful error messages has good usability.

### Utility

* Does the system provide the raw capabilities to allow the user to achieve their goal

The key aspects of utility are :
   -   **Relevance:** How well does the system address the user's specific requirements or objectives?
    -   **Functionality:** Does the system provide the necessary features and tools to accomplish tasks?
    -   **Value:** How much value does the user perceive in using the system?
    -   **Fit for Purpose:** Is the system designed to serve its intended purpose effectively?
   
*Example:* A project management software that includes features such as task tracking, team collaboration, and reporting provides utility for users managing complex projects.
