## Distributed Computing
Use of distributed systems to solve computational problems.
Ex. Internet, ATM machines, Intranets.

### Computers in a Distributed computing system
* **Workstations** : Used by end users
* **Server systems** : Provide resources and services
*  **Personal Assistance Devices** : Handheld computers connected via wifi

### Properties of Distributed Computing
* Fault Tolerance
* Nodes play partial role
* Resource sharing
* Load sharing
* Easy to expand
* Performance

### Advantages of Distributed Computing
* Nature of application
* Performance
	* Computing Intensive
	* Data Intensive
* Robustness 
	* No single point of failure
