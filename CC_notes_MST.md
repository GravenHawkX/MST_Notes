Q1. What are the different trends in computing? ==GDUCC==
Ans. There are 5 types of trends in Computing : 
1. Grid Computing
2. Distributed Computing
3. Cluster Computing
4. Utility Computing
5. Cloud Computing

Q2. What are Distributed Applications?
Ans. 
* Appliccations that ==consist of a set of process that are distributed acrosss a network of computers== that work as an ensemble to solve a common problem
* Client- Server : ==Resource management is centralized to the server==
* Peer to peer computing : It represents a movement toward ==truly distributed applications==


Q3. What are the different types of grids ? ==CDCNU==
Ans. There are 5 different types of drigs

1. Computational Grid : 
	*	Access to pool of processing power for computation intensive computing.
2. Data Grid : 
	* Infra to support *storage*, *discovery*, *handling*, *publication* and *manipulation* of data.
3. Collaboration Grid : 
	* Collaboration on different projects without revealing sensitive information.
4. Network Grid : 
	* Fault-tolerant and high performance comm^n^ services.
5. Utility Grid : 
	* Ultimate form. Data and computation cycles as well as software or any other resource is shared.

Q4. What is Grid computing ?
Ans. 
* It is a form of networking.
* Uses the processing cycles of other computers, to solve problems too intensive for a single computer.
* It creates vast IT capabilities by combining various data resources from multiple computers on the network, such as processing, network bandwidth, and storage capacity.

Q5. What is Cluster Computing ?
Ans 
* It is a type of parallel or dsitributed Computer system, where inter connected stand alone computers work together as  single computing unit.
* Key components are : ==computers, OS's, middleware, parallel programming env, and applications.==

Q6. What are the components of a cluster ?
 Ans. 1. Cluster nodes
 2. Cluster Network
 3. Network Characterization

Q7. Benefits of cluster computing ? ==SHOSH==
Ans. The benefits of cluster computing are as follows : 
* System Availability : high availability
* Hardware Fault Tolerance : Redundancy for h/w and s/w
* OS and application reliability : Run multiple copies
* Scalability : Adding servers
* High Performance : Running cluster enabled programs

## Distributed Computing
Use of distributed systems to solve computational problems.
Ex. Internet, ATM machines, Intranets.

### Computers in a Distributed computing system
* **Workstations** : Used by end users
* **Server systems** : Provide resources and services
*  **Personal Assistance Devices** : Handheld computers connected via wifi

### Properties of Distributed Computing ~FERLEP~
* Fault Tolerance
* Each node plays a partial role
* Resource sharing
* Load sharing
* Easy to expand
* Performance

### Advantages of Distributed Computing
* Nature of application
* Performance
	* Computing Intensive
	* Data Intensive
* Robustness 
	* No single point of failure


## Grid Computing
"The grid" links together computing resources and provides the mechanism needed toa ccess them

### Uses of grid computing

### Grid components : 
* **Users** 
* **Groups**
* **Sites**
<hr>

## Cluster Computing 

Consists of a collection of inter connected stand-alone computers working together as  single integrated computing resource


### Components of Cluster Computing 
* **PCs, Workstations, SMPs**
* **Operating systems**
* **Middleware**
* **Parallel programming environments**
* **Applications**

### Key operational benefits of clustering ~SHOSH~
* **System Availability** : Offer inherent high sustem availbility due to redundancy of hardware.
* **Hardware Fault Tolerance** : Redundancy for most system components , including both hardware and software.
* **OS and App Reliability** : Run multiple copies of the OS and apps.
* **Scalability** : Adding servers to the cluster or adding more clusters to the network.
* **High Performace** : Running cluster enabled programs

## Utility Computing
It is a service provisioning model in which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to the customer as needed and charges them for specific usage, rather than a flat rate.
> It's concept is a pay-per-use model.


### Main properties of utility computing 
1. Pay-for-user pricing business model
2. Data center virtualization and provisioning
3. Solves resource utilization problem
4. Outsourcing
5. Web services Delivery
6. Automation

## Risks of Utility Computing
* Data Backup
* Data Security
* Partner Competency
* Defining SLA
* Getting value from chargeback

<hr>

## Cloud Computing
*It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources.*


### Essential characteristics of Cloud computing : 
* On-demand self-service :
	* A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction.
* Broad Network access : 
	* All the services provided are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms ( Mobile phones, laptops, tablets, etc )
* Resource Pooling
	* The providers computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.

### Cloud Characteristics
* Measured Service
